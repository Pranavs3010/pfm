# Personal Finance Management (PFM) Dashboard

## Project Overview
The **Personal Finance Management (PFM) Dashboard** is a web application designed to help users manage their finances efficiently. In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, individuals struggle to track their income, expenses, and investments across multiple platforms. This dashboard aggregates all financial data into a single, intuitive interface, allowing users to:

- Understand spending habits
- Monitor net worth
- Set and track budgets
- Make informed financial decisions

For the industry, such platforms drive user engagement and provide anonymized data for developing other financial products.
